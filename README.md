# WaveKit

**An On-Premise Observability and Management UI for RisingWave**

![WaveKit Cover](docs/images/cover.png)

WaveKit is a user-friendly, on-premise tool designed to enhance observability and simplify management for your existing RisingWave clusters. It provides a web-based interface to connect to, monitor, and interact with RisingWave, whether it's deployed via Docker, Kubernetes, or on RisingWave Cloud.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Centralized Cluster View:** Connect to and manage all your RisingWave instances from a single dashboard.
*   **Status Monitoring:** Get at-a-glance insights into the status and basic information of your connected clusters.
*   **Direct `risectl` Execution:** Run `risectl` commands on your clusters directly from the WaveKit UI.
*   **Metadata Snapshot Management:** Easily create manual snapshots and configure automated backups for your RisingWave cluster metadata.
*   **Diagnostic Collection:** Trigger and automate the collection of diagnostic information for advanced troubleshooting.
*   **Interactive SQL Console:**
    *   Securely connect to specific databases within your RisingWave clusters.
    *   Explore schemas, tables, views, materialized views, sources, and sinks.
    *   Execute SQL queries with multi-tab support and query history.
    *   Visualize data flows with an integrated **Streaming Graph** for streaming queries.
*   **On-Premise Control:** Host WaveKit within your own environment, ensuring your connection details and metadata remain under your control.

## 📋 Prerequisites

*   **A running RisingWave cluster:** WaveKit connects to existing, operational RisingWave instances.
*   **PostgreSQL Database for WaveKit Metadata:** WaveKit uses a PostgreSQL database to store its own configuration (e.g., connection details for your RisingWave clusters). This can be self-hosted or the one bundled with specific WaveKit Docker images.
*   **Docker (Recommended):** If you plan to use the Docker-based installation methods for WaveKit.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker with Persistent Storage)

This is the recommended way to get started quickly with WaveKit, ensuring your WaveKit metadata persists.

1.  Ensure Docker is installed and running.
2.  Run the following command (replace `vX.Y.Z` with the latest WaveKit version, e.g., `v0.4.0`):
    ```shell
    docker run -d -p 8020:8020 --name wavekit \
      -e WK_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password \
      -v wavekit-data:/var/lib/postgresql \
      risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
    ```
    *   This uses the `-pgbundle` image which includes PostgreSQL.
    *   `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
    *   `-p 8020:8020` maps the port.
    *   `-e WK_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password` sets a custom initial password for the `root` user. **Recommended!**
    *   `-v wavekit-data:/var/lib/postgresql` creates a Docker volume named `wavekit-data` to persist PostgreSQL data.

3.  Access WaveKit: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8020`.
4.  Login with:
    *   **Username:** `root`
    *   **Password:** `your_secure_password` (or `root` if `WK_ROOT_PASSWORD` was not set).

## 🛠️ Other Installation Methods

WaveKit offers flexibility in how it can be deployed:

*   **Docker (Ephemeral Storage):** For quick testing without persistence. Metadata is lost if the container is removed.
    ```shell
    docker run --rm -p 8020:8020 --name wavekit risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
    ```
*   **Standalone Binary:** Download the binary and run it directly, connecting to your own existing PostgreSQL instance.
    ```shell
    # 1. Download
    curl https://wavekit-release.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/download.sh | sh
    # 2. Run (ensure WK_PG_DSN is set)
    WK_PG_DSN="postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname" WK_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password ./wavekit
    ```
*   **Docker Compose (Recommended for Production with Self-Managed PG):** Use Docker Compose to manage WaveKit and (optionally) a dedicated PostgreSQL container. See example `docker-compose.yaml` in our [Installation Guide](risingwave.com/wavekit/installation-setup).
    ```yaml
    # Example snippet for docker-compose.yaml using non-pgbundle image
    # services:
    #   wavekit:
    #     image: risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z
    #     ports: ["8020:8020"]
    #     environment:
    #       WK_PG_DSN: "your_postgres_dsn"
    #       WK_ROOT_PASSWORD: "your_secure_password"
    #   # ... your PostgreSQL service definition ...
    ```

## 💻 Using WaveKit

Once WaveKit is running and you've logged in:

1.  **Connect Your RisingWave Cluster:**
    *   Navigate to the "Clusters" section.
    *   Click "Add Cluster" and provide the connection details (Host, SQL Port, Meta Node Port, HTTP Port, Version) for your existing RisingWave cluster.
    *   Test and save the connection.

2.  **Explore Cluster Details:**
    *   From the "Clusters" list, click on your connected cluster to view its details page.
    *   Here you can:
        *   View cluster information and status.
        *   Execute `risectl` commands.
        *   Manage metadata snapshots.
        *   Collect diagnostic information.

3.  **Use the SQL Console:**
    *   Navigate to the "SQL Console" section.
    *   Click "Manage Databases" to add a new database connection, linking it to one of your configured clusters and providing RisingWave database credentials.
    *   Write and execute SQL queries, explore schemas, view query history, and visualize streaming graphs.

## ⚙️ Configuration

WaveKit can be configured using environment variables. For a detailed list of available settings, please refer to our [Configuration Guide](docs/config.md).

Key variables include:
*   `WK_PORT`: Port for the WaveKit UI (default: `8020`).
*   `WK_PG_DSN`: PostgreSQL connection string for WaveKit's metadata.
*   `WK_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Initial password for the `root` UI user (default: `root`).
*   `WK_RISECTLDIR`: Path related to `risectl` resources if needed.
